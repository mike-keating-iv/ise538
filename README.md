## Practical Machine Learning for Engineerin Analytics
## ISE 538 Summer 2025

### Course Description
One of the critical aspects of this course is the focus on practical examples and hands-on experience with machine learning tools and techniques. 
Through lectures, case studies, interactive assignments, and projects, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of machine learning applications in engineering analytics. 
The course will cover fundamental machine learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, and neural-networks. Students will also learn about different types of algorithms and their applications to engineering problems. The course will also cover data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Students will work on projects that simulate real-world scenarios, allowing them to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical setting. This will enable them to deeply understand how machine learning can be used to solve complex engineering problems and make informed decisions.
